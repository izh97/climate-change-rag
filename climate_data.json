However, economies share a heavy reliance on primary products and natural resources, which account for approximately 50 per cent of all good exports. Urban areas continue to grow along with populations, coupled with growing consumption by middle classes. This has led to a situation in which air quality in cities has declined, emissions are growing, and water and other natural resources are under pressure. The future of the region\u2019s economies depends heavily on the region\u2019s natural capital, mitigating and adapting to climate change, and decoupling economic growth from resource consumption.

There is a growing concern that if the average global temperature rises more than 2 \u00baC degrees above pre-industrial levels, it could have severe implications for health (Watts et al. 2015; Butler 2014). Initially, the focus was on heat stress and changes in the range of vector-borne diseases like malaria. However, attention is now shifting to more indirect health effects, including impacts on food production, conflict, and migration (King et al. 2015; Butler 2014). It is increasingly acknowledged that heat stress, compounded by the urban heat island effect, not only affects productivity but also raises the risk of injuries (King et al. 2015). Vulnerable populations such as the elderly, the impoverished, and individuals with mental illness and chronic diseases, particularly cardiac and dementia-related conditions, are at heightened risk from excessive heat, especially during nighttime and prolonged periods of high temperatures (Oudin \u00c5str\u00f6m et al. 2011). Furthermore, disasters exacerbated by rising sea levels are another climate change-related threat to health. Many areas in Asia and the Pacific, particularly informal settlements located in environmentally fragile regions along shorelines and major river basins, are susceptible to natural disasters. These observations underscore the multidimensional impact of climate change on health in the Asia Pacific region and the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address these challenges."

Economic activities, global market-driven production, and intensified industrialization lead to unsustainable consumption and lifestyle choices with higher levels of pollution and carbon intensity. The rise in land transport, particularly due to insufficient or ineffective public transport systems and poorly maintained vehicles, leads to increased emissions from buses, cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Additionally, the increasing air traffic and mobility resulting from rising incomes and the growth of budget airlines in the region contribute to higher transboundary emissions."

Much of this waste was initially disposed of by ships, with international agreements to ban such practices only coming into force in 1988. In recent years, microplastics have emerged as a growing concern in the context of ocean pollution. Data indicates that the majority of ocean plastic waste originates from land-based sources, whether it is found washed up on shores or concentrated within gyres. Notably, an analysis of the estimated mass of plastic waste generated by coastal populations in 2010 identified China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka as the top five land-based sources of ocean plastic waste in the Asia-Pacific region.

The continual expansion of urban areas and agricultural land can generate significant pressure on natural ecosystems. However, strategically planned urbanization has the potential to optimize land utilization and potentially alleviate the strain on natural ecosystems. Noteworthy examples of this approach include the extensive re-establishment of natural vegetation in millions of hectares of land surrounding abandoned villages and agricultural areas in rural China. In addition to urban growth, the region is also confronting the challenges associated with changing climate patterns and escalating water consumption. It is anticipated that by 2050, as urban clusters expand, there will be a substantial dearth of freshwater resources, potentially leading to severe shortages. The projections indicate that around 94 million people in Asia are expected to be residing in cities facing chronic water shortages by 2050. "

Despite the adoption of various technologies for decomposing cyanide species, most gold mines in South Africa continue to discharge cyanide with the effluent and tailings under the assumption that it will naturally decompose within a relatively short period of time. This approach raises concerns about the potential environmental impact, as cyanide discharge can have negative consequences for the ecosystem and water quality, particularly in the context of climate change. Therefore, there is a need to reassess and consider alternative methods for managing cyanide discharge to mitigate its potential impact on the environment in South Africa."

This suggests that residual cyanide from historical processing has persisted in the tailings for a significant period, ranging from 30 to 80 years, depending on the tailings facility. When the old slurries were reworked in a new facility, there was a rapid decline in the pH of the superficial drying layer after deposition ceased. In 2006, elevated concentrations of total cyanide and weak acid dissociable cyanide were recorded. Additionally, the concentrations of free cyanide, cyanates, and thiocyanates were higher in 2007 compared to 2006, while the concentrations of metal cyanide complexes were higher in 2006 compared to 2007. These findings suggest that metal cyanide species in the superficial layers of the tailings degraded rapidly post-deposition, primarily due to a decrease in pH."

While the levels of mercury found in water, soil, and sediments are currently below the safe guideline values set by the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevailing situation presents a significant environmental threat. Many individuals involved in gold mining are unaware of the hazards associated with mercury usage in mining activities. When exposed to atmospheric, aquatic, and terrestrial influences, mercury can undergo transformation, ultimately converting into Methyl-mercury, the most toxic form of the metal. Methyl-mercury easily infiltrates living organisms and builds up in the food chain, leading to contamination of fish and other aquatic species, thereby posing a risk to populations consuming such contaminated fish. Moreover, mercury entering the environment travels downstream in river systems, potentially reaching the coastal region in the Gulf of Guinea. Implementation of a legal framework governing artisanal mining could result in transforming the sector into a regulated industry, ultimately reducing its impact on the environment."

This process involves the use of mercury to separate gold from ore, resulting in the creation of an amalgam of equal parts mercury and gold, which is then heated and rinsed with river water. The vaporized mercury eventually settles in the soil and sediment of lakes, rivers, and oceans, where it undergoes transformation into methylmercury (MeHg). MeHg enters the food chain in bodies of water, as it is absorbed by phytoplankton, which are in turn consumed by zooplankton and fish. As a result, mercury becomes accumulated in these organisms, leading to potential toxic effects in humans who regularly consume fish. Specifically, studies by Ashe (2012) in the Peruvian province of Madre de Dios have observed the toxic effects of mercury, particularly on the skin and the central and peripheral nervous system. This highlights the environmental and health concerns surrounding the impact of gold washing on the Madre de Dios river basin in the context of climate change in Latin America."

This abundance of food makes mangroves one of the most productive systems on Earth. Additionally, the contribution of plant material from mangroves is essential for regulating climate and serving as a water source. The movement of water from the Earth to the sea and back is fundamental in the water cycle, and mangroves play a vital role in this process. Evaporation, which occurs at higher temperatures where mangrove ecosystems are located, is a key part of the water cycle. Mangroves can absorb water through their leaves or roots, and they also release water vapor into the atmosphere. This water vapor contributes to the formation of clouds, leading to rain events in other areas. As the evaporated water condenses and falls into rivers, streams, and eventually the ocean, the water cycle begins anew. Therefore, the protection and conservation of mangroves are crucial not only for their ecosystem, but also for their role in influencing the climate and water cycle."

Furthermore, it provides essential ecosystem services valued at around US $15,500 million, with two-thirds attributed to water provision and disturbance regulation. Despite being one of the best-preserved ecosystems in South America, the basin of the Paran\u00e1 has suffered significant loss, with up to 60 percent of natural vegetation already depleted. This destruction poses significant consequences for the ecosystem's health. Although periodic floods play a role in the Pantanal's conservation, approximately 5,000 square kilometers of flooding forests (13 percent of its original extent) were deforested in the last century. Moreover, up to 44 percent of the area exhibited signs of degradation by human activities and wildlife impacts by 2004. Additionally, the Pantanal faces threats from water pollution, infrastructure development, settlement, unregulated tourism, and invasive species. Efforts are thus needed to safeguard this critical ecosystem and mitigate the detrimental impacts of human activities and environmental changes."

Over the last four decades, approximately 40 percent of coral cover has been lost, reflecting the severity of the situation. The rise in sea surface temperatures, particularly during El Ni\u00f1o years, has led to widespread coral bleaching events in 1998, 2010, and 2016, with the 2016 incident possibly being the most severe on record. This is indicative of the increasing impact of climate change on coral reefs. Furthermore, ocean acidification, a consequence of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, poses an additional threat to coral reefs. This phenomenon particularly affects reef calcifiers, such as hard corals and giant clams, resulting in reduced calcification rates and productivity. Therefore, the combined effects of rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification are posing significant challenges to the health and survival of coral reefs globally."

For example, in the United States, systemic underinvestment in racially segregated neighbourhoods can be traced back to discriminatory \"redlining\" practices from the 1930s, leading to ongoing social and health disparities for residents in these areas. Furthermore, the absence of official zoning in some locations allows city governments to create \"grey spaces\" that benefit dominant social or higher-income groups at the expense of marginalized urban dwellers."

Furthermore, this plastic consumption can lead to bioaccumulation through predator-prey relationships, exacerbating its impact on marine ecosystems. The ingestion of plastic can also prove fatal for marine animals, as the accumulation of plastic in their stomachs can lead to blockages and damage to internal organs. Additionally, animals are at risk of physical entanglement in discarded plastic items such as fishing nets or plastic rings from beverage packaging, which can lead to adverse outcomes such as strangulation, starvation, or drowning. These findings underscore the urgent need to address the issue of macro-plastics in the Asia Pacific to mitigate their detrimental effects on marine ecosystems."

While attention has traditionally focused on larger plastic items contributing to ocean garbage patches, there is a growing awareness of the impact of microplastics in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. The term \"microplastic\" was first coined in 2004 and is defined as plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in diameter, including nano-sized particles that can originate from either primary sources (such as deliberate addition to products or industrial releases) or secondary sources (resulting from the breakdown of larger plastic items or washing of man-made fibers). The implications of microplastics are underscored by research indicating their presence in various ecosystems, as well as their potential to accumulate in organisms and contribute to environmental pollution. Studies have raised concerns about the environmental and ecological impacts of microplastics, calling for increased understanding, monitoring, and management of this emerging issue in the region."

The pace and scale of this industrialization pose challenges for government regulations and controls which are struggling to keep up with this swift development. As a result, there is a need for a multi-benefit, multi-governance approach to address the environmental and economic aspects of the issue. This approach aims to achieve an optimal mix of finance and governance, taking into consideration the complexity of the situation. Governance innovation is seen as a key element in supporting the packaging of policies, which can include the use of low-cost environmental sensors, citizen science, and e-governance.

In Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, land abandonment has been a major driver. Abandonment mostly occurs in marginal areas with limited natural productivity and in sporadic cases also in productive ones due to migration and socio-economic factors.
